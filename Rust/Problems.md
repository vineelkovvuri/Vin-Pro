161. /* Menu driven program on files

CREATE A FILE CALLED MARKS.DAT WITH THE STRUCTURE STUDENT
NUMBER, STUDENT NAME, MARKS IN PAPER1, MARKS IN PAPER2, AND
MARKS IN PAPER3. INPUT ANY RECORDS. CALCULATE THE TOTAL
AND AVERAGE FOR EACH STUDENT.

IF AVERAGE IS >=60 THEN
DECLARE THE RESULT AS FIRST;
COPY THAT STUDENT INFORMATION TO A FILE CALLED FIRST.DAT
  WITH HIS NUMBER, NAME, TOTAL AND AVERAGE.

IF AVERAGE IS >=50 THEN
  DECLARE THE RESULT AS SECOND;
  COPY THAT STUDENT INFORMATION TO A FILE CALLED SECOND.DAT
  WITH AGAIN HIS NUMBER, NAME, TOTAL AND AVERAGE.

IF AVERAGE IS <50 THEN
  DECLARE THE RESULT AS FAIL;
  COPY THAT STUDENT INFORMATION TO A FILE CALLED FAIL.DAT
  WITH AGAIN HIS NUMBER, NAME, TOTAL AND AVERAGE.
