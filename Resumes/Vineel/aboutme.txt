I am Vineel, From Hyderabad. Currently working in Nvidia as a System software developer.
I maintain android's Surfaceflinger which is a lower level component in the android stack
reponsible for composing UI elements. I have also worked on an android application called dabbler 
which was showcased on Nvidia's Tegra Tablet. I am also proud to be the author of display
driver for Google's Nexus 9 tablet

So I am pretty much confortable with the complete android stack ranging from low-level
System's progamming to high level app development.

Comming to education background.
I completed my post graduation(M.Tech) in Computer Science from IIIT hyderabad. 
one of the top 3 universities in INDIA.

I am also certified in JAVA and .NET technologies. Also I can rate myself as an expert in git. 
I hosted some of my hobby project in github. Also I am good at debugging skills.

I personally have high coding standards. Most of the code that we write in nvidia will
end up being in Android framework(AOSP).

My hobbies include blogging, Listening to music.
I am an avid blogger and I contribute a lot through my website.

Also I am very good at algorithms and data structures. 
I know how to use chrome dev-tools for client side web debugging
I know how to use debuggers like setting data break points etc
