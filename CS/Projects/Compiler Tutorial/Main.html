Compilers are surely the complex programs of all times. Even today writing a compiler with minimum set of tools is considered to be challenging.
This tutorial scratches the surface of compiler internals by explaining the phases that are involved for translating a Source file in to a Target file(may be to machine readable language(exe,a.out) or to another human readable language).

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection" target="_blank" class="externallink">GNU compiler collection</a> is an excellent set of tools for dissecting the compilation process and to understand the working of bits and bytes in the final executable. For this tutorial I am using the following tools and considers  C language  to illustrate the examples. </p>
<ol> 
<li><a href="http://orwelldevcpp.blogspot.in/" target="_blank"  class="externallink">Dev-Cpp</a> Contains GNU C compiler with a nice frontend for source code editing - an alternative to Visual Studio for beginners </li>
<li><a href="http://www.ollydbg.de/" target="_blank"  class="externallink">OllyDbg</a> An excellent debugger with very rich functionality </li>
<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank"  class="externallink">Vim</a> A text editor ( optional - Old habits are hard to break :) )</li>
</ol>

Many people don't know that the powerful programmer tools that are available for linux environment are also available to windows ( thanks to GNU ). Dev-Cpp is one such tool which consists of entire GNU compiler collection( GCC ) and an editor for writing programs. This software uses <strong>gcc.exe, g++.exe</strong> for compiling <strong>C, C++</strong> programs respectively and <strong>gdb.exe</strong> for debugging.
</p>
<p>
At present keep dev-cpp aside and concentrate on <strong>bin directory</strong> of dev-cpp's installation(<strong>c:\dev-cpp\bin</strong>). This directory consists of all the GNU compiler tools. To start this tutorial set the <strong><a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm" target="_blank" class="externallink">PATH</a></strong>  variable to dev-cpp's bin directory.
</p>
<p>
If you are a beginner with little programming experience then using GNU Debugger (gdb.exe) may seem like a daunting task. To compensate this we have an excellent user mode debugger for windows -<strong>OllyDbg</strong>. With the help of this tool we can debug a running process or a normal exe or dll file individually.
This ends the description of the Tools of the trade.

Many of us may be excellent C programmers but very few of us care about understanding the internal workings of a compiler. To be frank enough very few of us explores the compiler options and its command line switches(arguments). If you know how your compiler workers I am sure you will become geek in the chosen programming language. So I try to explain the various compiler switches in understanding different phases of a compilation process.
