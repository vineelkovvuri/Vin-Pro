Description
===========

HTMLAsText utility converts HTML documents to simple text files, by
removing all HTML tags and formatting the text according to your
preferences.



Features
========


* HTMLAsText automatically removes all tags and scripts from the
  document.

  per line that you select.

  corresponding ASCII characters.
* Unordered lists (<ul> tag) and ordered lists (<ol> tag) are formatted
  accordingly. The bullets beside the items of unordered lists are
  replaced by ASCII characters according to your selection.

  the definition lines.

  accordingly by adding space characters in the left side of the lines.

  CRLF.
* Preformatted text blocks (<pre> tag) are copied "as is", without
  formatting the text.
