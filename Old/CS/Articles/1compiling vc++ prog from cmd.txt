Making DLL's in MicroSoft Visual C++ 6.0
Working from the command line

First, check that your DOS environment variable PATH contains MSVC. I have a file setenv.bat which sets it:

set INCLUDE=c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vc98\Include
set LIB=c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vc98\lib
set LIB = %LIB%;c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vc98\mfc\lib;
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vc98\bin
set PATH=%PATH%;c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\common\msdev98\bin;

Now we make a one-line DLL. Here's the source:

extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void myfun(int * a){*a = - *a; }

Save this to file myfun.cpp and compile it from the DOS prompt with

cl -LD myfun.cpp

The -LD switch says to generate a DLL. Next we make an executable which calls the DLL. Here's the source:

#include iostream.h

extern C __declspec(dllimport) void myfun ( int * a);

void main(void)
{
 int a = 6;
 int b = a;
 myfun(&b);

 cout << '-' << a << " is " << b << "! \n";
}

Save this to file main.cpp. Then compile and link from the command prompt with

cl main.cpp /link myfun.lib

Execute it from the command line (just type 'main') and watch with awe!
