base
Pointer to the first element of the array to be sorted.
num
Number of elements in the arr     y pointed by base.
size
Size in bytes of each           element in the array.
comparator
Function that compares two eleme			nts. The function shall follow this prototype:

int comparator ( const void * elem1, const void * elem2 );

The function must accept two parameters that are pointers to elements, 
type-casted as void*. These parameters should be cast back to some data type and be compared.

The return value of this function should represent whether elem1 is considered 
less than, equal to, or greater than elem2 by returning, respectively, a negative value, zero or a positive value.
