You will need lame.exe.  Get it here:  http://www.mp3dev.org/mp3/
put it in the c:\ directory to use my defaults
		
		
assembled by Kenton Brown, kenton@crossroadmission.org but I got the info from various sources.
I decided to assemble this example after spending several hours searching
for this type of information for C#
remember that 'int, uint' in C# is the same length (32 bits, 4 bytes) as a 'long'
in visual basic, and DWORD or UINT in C++
credit given to C#HELP where I found the mp3 example
credit given to all the other places I found the winmm.lib info
visual C++ example http:www.cs.binghamton.edu/~reckert/360/11.html

the end of the file has the lame.exe help file and info on converting types between languages
put the lame.exe in same directory as your test wave file to convert wav to mp3
first confirm your mic is working
code your project directory
record a wave file

To use this as is just put the lame.exe program in the c:\ directory and record a wave
don't forget to hit t and enter to stop the recording
lame.exe is at http://www.webattack.com/get/lame.shtml

THIS CODE IS FREE.  ALL CODE EXAMPLES I USED WERE ALSO FREE.
