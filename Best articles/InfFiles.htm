<p><font size="7"><b>J</b></font>ust the other day, while walking through the hundred acre
wood, I was accosted by the local fauna.</p>

<p>"Excuse me", asked a small pink pig. "B-B-B-But do you know
anything about Windows Device Drivers? Because, if you do, our friend here
needs some help", he said, pointing to a rather rolly
polly teddy bear.</p>

<p>"What kind of help?", I asked the
little bear.</p>

<p>"Well", replied the little bear, "I am a Bear of Little
Brain. I just wrote a Windows Device Driver, but I dont know how to install it".</p>

<p>"What you need to do, is write an .INF file, which describes
your driver and the device it controls, to the Windows operating system", I
said. "Uh, by the way, what device does your driver control?".</p>

<p>"It is a hunny filter.  It removes dirt, bees, and other impurities
in hunny. It is my own invention.",
he said rather proudly.</p>

<p>"Hmm", I thought to myself, "not bad for a Bear of Little
Brain".</p>

<p>"Do you think, that is to say, do you know how to write one
of these 'Dot Eye Eneff' files?",
the bear asked.</p>

<p>"Sure, why dont we all sit down right here, and Ill tell
you all about .INF files – Hey, wheres everyone going?  Come back! Theyre not that bad!"</p>

<p>The small group of animals slowly reappeared, one by one,
with more than a little trepidation in their eyes.</p>

<p>"Dont worry, .INF files arent nearly as bad as you think",
I said, trying to sooth their fears.</p>

<p>"W-W-Well, thats n-n-not what m-m-most p-p-people say",
said the little pink pig, clearly frightened.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself my little friend, nervous eaters dont grow
up to be big tasty – er, healthy pigs", I said.</p>

<p>The little pig calmed down noticeably, but still regarded me
with suspicion.</p>

<h1>Purpose of .INF Files</h1>

<p>Ask just about any device driver writer, "What is the worst
part of writing Windows device drivers?" and most will reply, "Writing .INF
files!" The reason for this is that the documentation on .INF files in the DDK
has not provided a procedural approach to describing .INF files, such as, "If
you want to accomplish X, then do Y followed by Z".</p>

<p>This article will describe the basics of .INF files and how
they are used in the installation of a device driver.</p>

<p>An .INF file can do many things; however, 97% of all .INF
files really only perform three tasks:</p>

<p>Identify the driver for a particular device. This is done
using one or more Hardware IDs or Compatible IDs. The system device installer
will take the Hardware IDs and Compatible IDs that were reported for a device
(by its bus driver), and try and find an exact character for character match in
an .INF file. When a match is found, then the system device installer knows
that the .INF file describes the driver(s) for the device.</p>

<p>Copy files from the installation medium to the system. In
addition to the driver binary (the .SYS file), driver packages may also include
DLLs, co-installers, applications, or any other type of file.</p>

<p>Add entries to the registry. This describes the device and
its relationship to other devices, provides for device or driver specific
configuration information, and describes the driver "service" to the service
control manager.</p>

<p>Thats it. Sounds simple, doesnt it? Actually, it is pretty
simple (no, Im not kidding!).</p>

<p>"Youre right", replied the little bear, "even a Bear of
Little Brain understands that"</p>

<p>The two most confusing aspects of .INF files are usually:</p>

<p>The .INF file is not 'run from the beginning to the end;
individual sections in the .INF file are 'run based upon the phase of the
installation process.</p>

<p>Most of the sections in the .INF file are actually part of a
well-defined hierarchy. This fact is obscured by the squashing of the hierarchy
into a flat text file.  </p>

<h1>Structure</h1>

<p>An .INF file consists of tables called 'sections, and
comments. Each section has a name, which
is enclosed in square brackets, e.g.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">[SectionName]</font></p>

<p>All section names are case insensitive, and may in theory be
up to 255 non-whitespace ANSI or Unicode characters
in length (although Win9x requires names to be less than 19 ANSI characters). Spaces,
tabs, other control characters, and [%];"\ are not allowed (well, in some cases
some of those characters are allowed, but to simplify things, lets just not
use them). To separate words in a section name, do <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>not</b> use periods ("."), which are reserved to Microsoft; instead,
use the underscore ("_") or dash ("-"), e.g.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">[My_model-section]</font></p>

<p>Each section contains zero or more 'directives (yes, that means that sections may be empty). The directives
tell the system device installer what to do, e.g. copy a file, or add an entry
to the registry. The comment character is the semi-colon (";"), which can
appear anywhere on a line.</p>

<p>There are no conditional statements in the .INF language,
which means there are no "IF-THEN-ELSE" or other similar constructs; however,
section names can be 'decorated with a platform-dependent suffix which the
system device installer will preferentially select when installing on the
specified platform, e.g.</p>



<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">[SectionName.NT]</font></p>


<p>This is a section that will only be 'run on Windows 2000 or
later.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the sections are not 'run in the
order in which they appear in the file, sections are 'run based upon the
installation phase; therefore, sections may appear in any order in the file.
Although, by convention, the [Version] section is always first, and the
[Strings] section is always last.</p>

<p>There are several strings in an .INF file that will be
displayed to the user. There is a string substitution capability within .INF
files that works very similarly to the #define macro in C. String substitution
macros are defined in a section called [Strings]. The directives in the section
define the string macros, e.g.</p>

<p><br>
<font face="Courier New" size="2">
[Strings]<br>
my_company = "California Death Beams
and Stuff"<br>
my_device = "Basselope
2003 Stealth Weapons System"</font></p>



<p>The system device installer will perform the macro
substitution where ever it finds a macro invocation of the form %macro-name%,
e.g.</p>

<p><br>
<font face="Courier New" size="2">
[Manufacturer]<br>
%my_company% = install_my_stuff</font></p>

<p>Most people in the world who use computers generally have an
'English to their language dictionary next to their computer, but frankly,
non-English speaking people would much rather have everything on their computer
output in their own language. You can declare all the printable strings in your
.INF file using these macros, and the system device installer will chose the
correct strings based upon what language the user has installed on the system. </p>

<p>You do this by providing multiple [Strings] sections. Each
string section may be decorated (decorated names were discussed earlier) with a
Language ID. The Language ID follows the same form used in the SDK, and
consists of a four digit hexadecimal number with the low ten bits indicating
the primary language, and the upper six bits indicating the sublanguage. For
example, U.S. English is 0409. The definitions of the language and sublanguage
IDs are in the SDK. For example:</p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">[Strings]               ; Default, US  English</font><font face="Courier New" size="2"><br>
one = "One"<br>
two = "Two"</font><font face="Courier New" size="2"><br>
&nbsp;<br>
[Strings.040c]
French (Standard)<br>
one = "Un"<br>
two = &quot;Deux&quot;<br>
<br>
[Strings.080a]          ; Spanish (Mexico)<br>
one = &quot;Uno&quot;<br>
two = "Dos"</font></p>

<p>With the above strings sections, whereever
the system device installer encounters %one% or %two% in the .INF file, it will substitute it with the string from one of the
strings sections. If the user has installed some other language that isnt
specified in a strings section, the system will choose the default strings
section (without the decoration) for the macro definitions. An .INF file that
supports multiple languages is often referred to as having been 'localized.</p>

<h1>Commonly-used Sections</h1>

<p>If you look at the DDK documentation on .INF files, you will
find that there are 39 (as of this writing, new sections are added
occasionally) section types understood by the system device installer. Each
class installer, e.g. Network, Video, etc., can add its own section types, or
directives to existing sections.</p>

<p>Thirty-nine section types may seem a bit daunting, but 97%
of all .INF files can generally get away with about a dozen or so section
types, which well briefly cover. Of course, the DDK is the definitive source
for information on .INF files.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, most of the sections in the .INF
file are ordered in a hierarchy, as seen in figure 1:</p>

<p align="left"><img border="0" src="InfFig1.gif" width="563" height="452"></p>

<p>The sections on the left are not part of the hierarchy, and
are essentially 'global throughout the .INF file (G for global, G for green; I
know, it sounds like &quot;Sesame Street,&quot;
but it works). The root of the hierarchy is the [Manufacturer] section.</p>

<p>Some of the section names are required, because the section
is called by the system device installer (e.g. Manufacturer, Strings, Version,
.Service, .HW, etc.), other section names can be called whatever you like,
because they are only referenced from within the .INF file by you.</p>

<p>Following are the most commonly used sections and their most
commonly used directives. For a definitive list of sections
and their directives, look in the DDK documentation.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute", said the little bear, theres something
missing".</p>

<p>"What? Lets see, Manufacturer, Models, Install Component, AddReg, CopyFiles, .Services,
.HW, Version, Control Flags, SourceDisksNames, SourceDisksFiles, DestinationDirs,
and Strings. Yep, thats all of them. Whats missing?",
I said.</p>

<p>"Hunny".</p>

<p>"Hunny?",
I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes", the little bear replied, "you forgot Hunny".</p>

<p>"Um… Microsoft doesnt have a Hunny
section in .INF files", I said.</p>

<p>"Why not?", asked a puzzled little
bear.</p>

<p>"Well, .INF files are used for installing device drivers,
and you dont install Hunny in a computer system".</p>

<p>"Everythings better with Hunny",
he said rather smugly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Im … sure it is, but Hunny
is rather sticky, and -"</p>

<p>"The stickiness is the best part", he interrupted.</p>

<p>"OK, but I dont think it will do the circuits much good,
and for the record, I would prefer that you <i>not</i>
install Hunny in any of my systems!",
I said rather strongly.</p>

<p>"OK", he grudgingly agreed.</p>

<p>"Allright, can I get on with the
lesson?", I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, please", he replied.</p>

<h2>Version</h2>

<p>This is the standard header for all .INF files, and it
specifies which operating system and class installer can parse this .INF file.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">
;+<br>
; Identify this .INF file<br>
;-<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">[Version]<br>
Signature = &quot;$Chicago$&quot;       ; or $Windows NT$ for 2000/XP<br>
Class = Fishbowl
My class name<br>
ClassGUID =
{30320101-C613-11d2-9647-0020AFEB03E0}; My GUID<br>
Provider = %my_company%             ; My
company<br>
CatalogFile = Fishbowl.cat          ; WHQL checksum file<br>
DriverVer = 04/01/2003,1.0.121.1    ; Driver date &amp; version</font></p>

<p><i>Signature</i>
specifies which operating systems can parse this .INF file. $Chicago$ (why Chicago?
Who knows? I do know that 'Chicago was the code name for Windows 95, but what
that has to do with this I can't say) indicates that all versions of Windows
can parse it, while $Windows NT$ indicates Windows 2000 and later operating
systems.</p>

<p><i>Class</i> specifies
the name of the class the device is a member of. See DevGUID.H
for a list of predefined classes and their GUIDs. In
this case, I created my own class, the 'Fishbowl class. If you create your own
class name, then you must also have a ClassInstall32 section.</p>

<p><i>ClassGUID</i>
specifies the device class GUID for this .INF file. The Class and ClassGUID directives better match, or the device install
will fail. If you create your own class, create a new GUID using the GUIDGEN
tool in the DDK or SDK. If you are using a known class, e.g. Mouse, then look
up the GUID in DevGUID.H.</p>

<p><i>Provider</i>
identifies who wrote the .INF file. Generally, this will be the company that
produced the device, but it is often "Microsoft", since they write a lot of
.INF files for vendors.</p>

<p><i>CatalogFile</i>
specifies the file containing the digital signature of the driver and the .INF
file. This file is received from WHQL after a device/driver combination has
successfully passed the Hardware Compatibility Tests and received a logo.
During development, you wont have a catalog file, so either omit this
directive or point it to an empty file.</p>

<p><i>DriverVer</i>
identifies the date the driver was built and its version number. The system
device installer uses this information to select which .INF file to use, when
it finds more than one.</p>

<h2>ControlFlags</h2>

<p>This section specifies which devices need special processing
during the installation process.</p>

<p>;<font face="Courier New" size="2">+<br>
; This section prevents the user from being able to load<br>
; the driver unless the hardware is
present</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">;-<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">[ControlFlags]<br>
ExcludeFromSelect = *</font></p>

<p><i>ExcludeFromSelect</i>
is the most common directive used in a ControlFlags
section. It contains a list of which devices that are installed by this .INF
file reside on enumerable buses (buses that can uniquely identify each device
on its bus, e.g. PCI, but not ISA). This directive informs the Add Device
Wizard not to allow the user to select any of the specified devices for manual
installation. Instead, the driver will be loaded when the device is detected by
the PnP manager. If all devices installed by the .INF file are on enumerable
buses, then you may specify an asterisk; otherwise, specify the hardware ID or
compatible ID of each device, separated by a comma.</p>

<h2>SourceDisksNames</h2>

<p>This section identifies the installation disks that contain
the files to be copied to the system during the installation process.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">;+<br>
; Identify the installation media<br>
;-<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">[SourceDisksNames]<br>
1 = &quot;Fishbowl Installation Disk #1&quot;<br>
2 = "Fishbowl Installation Disk #2"</font></p>

<p>The directives for the SourceDisksNames
section are different from the directives we have discussed up to this point.
The format of the directive is:</p>

<p>disk-id =
disk-description[,[tag-file],[unused,path][,flags]]</p>

<p><i>disk-id</i>
is simply an ordinal number for a disk. Generally, disks are numbered starting
at one, and increase by one after.</p>

<p><i>disk-description</i>
is some string that identifies the disk. This string will be displayed to the
user when the system device installer requires the disk to be inserted into the
system. </p>

<p><i>tag-file</i>
is the name of a file known to be only on that disk. I usually use Notepad to
create a zero-length file on each disk, e.g. Disk1, Disk2, etc.</p>

<p><i>unused</i>
is not used in Windows 2000 and later.</p>

<p><i>path</i>
allows a subdirectory on the disk to be specified.</p>

<p><i>flags</i>
allow the tag-file to specify the name of a cabinet (.cab) file that the files
are in. On WinXP and later, if the cabinet file is used, then the tag-file name
follows the flags field.</p>

<h2>SourceDisksFiles</h2>

<p>This section identifies all the files that will be copied to
the system during the installation process.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">;+<br>
; Identify the files on the installation media<br>
;-<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">[SourceDisksFiles]<br>
Fish.hex = 1            ; on disk #1<br>
Fishbowl.sys = 2  ; on disk #2</font></p>

<p>Like the SourceDisksNames section,
the directives here are different from most other section types. In this case,
for each file that shall be copied to the system, the disk on which the file
resides is identified. This section works in conjunction with the SourceDisksFiles section. The format of the directive is:</p>

<p>filename =
disk-id[,[sub-directory][,size]]</p>

<p><i>filename</i>
is the name of a file on one of the installation disks.</p>

<p><i>disk-id</i>
is the disk the contains the file, and is listed in the SourceDisksNames
section.</p>

<p><i>sub-directory</i>
identifies a sub-directory on the disk in which the file is located.</p>

<p><i>size</i>
is the uncompressed size of the file in bytes. Generally not used.</p>

<h2>DestinationDirs</h2>

<p>This section specifies which directories on the system the
files will be copied to, by providing a list of section names that contain a
list of files and a directory number.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">;+<br>
; Identify where the files will be copied to<br>
;-<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">[DestinationDirs]<br>
Fb-W98-Driver-Files = 10,System32\Drivers<br>
Fb-W2K-Driver-Files = 12<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">[Fb-W98-Driver-Files]</font><font face="Courier New" size="2"><br>
driver.sys<br>
another_file.dat<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">[Fb-W2K-Driver-Files]</font><font face="Courier New" size="2"><br>
driver.sys<br>
different_file.dat</font></p>

<p>The format for directive in this section is:</p>

<p>section-name =
directory-id[,sub-directory]</p>

<p>section-name is the name of a
section created by the .INF file writer. This section contains a list of file
names (that are also listed in the SourceDisksFiles
section), that will be copied to a specific directory. Alternatively, the
reserved word "DefaultDestDir" may be used, which
specifies the destination directory for all files that do not have their destination
directory specified explicitly.</p>

<p><i>directory-id</i>
is a pre-defined identifier for a system directory. The most commonly used
directory-ids for driver writes are: 11 = %WinDir%\System32,
and 12 = %WinDir%\System32\Drivers, where %WinDir% is
a pre-defined environment variable that points to your system directory, not a
macro in the strings section.</p>

<p><i>sub-directory</i>
identifies a sub-directory of the directory identified by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>directory-id</i>.</p>

<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>This section provides macro definitions for strings used
within the .INF file.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">;+<br>
; String substitution definitions<br>
;-<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">[Strings]<br>
ClassName = &quot;Fishbowl&quot;<br>
MfgName = &quot;Sannas Consulting,
LLC.&quot;<br>
Fishbowl = &quot;Fishbowl USB Demonstration Device&quot;<br>
ServiceDesc = &quot;Fishbowl
driver&quot;</font></p>

<p>The format of this section is:</p>

<p>macro-name = "some string"</p>

<p><i>macro-name</i>
is the name of the macro defined for the string, and is de-referenced elsewhere
in the .INF file by surrounding it with percent ("%") signs, e.g. %macro-name%.</p>

<p><i>"some
string"</i> is the definition of the macro, and will replace the invocation of
the macro where ever it appears in the .INF file.</p>

<h2>Manfacturer</h2>

<p>This section is very similar to a directory; it lists all
the manufacturers whose devices are supported by this .INF file. For 3<sup>rd</sup>
parties, it is very rare for there to be more than one manufacturer listed;
however, .INF files written by Microsoft may have a dozen or more manufacturers
supported by a single .INF file. The manufacturer section is the root of the
hierarchy for the rest of the sections (see figure 1).</p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">;+<br>
; The root of the hierarchy for this file<br>
;-<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">[Manufacturer]<br>
%MfgName% = Sannas</font></p>

<p>The syntax for this section is also different from any other
section in the .INF file. If you look at the directive, it appears that a
quoted string (via the macro substitution) is being given the value of some
identifier. Well, that is not the case. The equal sign ("=") is not used as an
assignment operator, but as a separator (a rather poor choice for a separator,
but it is a separator none the less). This section is used during the early
phase of the installation process when the system device installer is searching
the .INF files for a matching Hardware ID or Compatible ID. The format of this
section is:</p>

<p>manufacturer-name =
models-section-name</p>

<p><i>manufacturer-name</i>
is some string that identifies the manufacturer.</p>

<p><i>models-section-name</i>
is the name of a section (created by the .INF file writer) that contains a list
of the device models for this manufacturer supported by this .INF file.</p>

<h2>Models</h2>

<p>This section identifies the various device models for a
particular manufacturer that are supported by this .INF file. The name of this
section is determined by the .INF file writer, and is referenced in the Manufacturer
section.</p>

<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">;+<br>
; Supported devices<br>
;-<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">[our_devices]<br>
%device1-name% = product-install, hardware_ID,
hardware_ID<br>
%device2-name% = product-install, compatible_ID</font></p>

<p>The directives in this section are similar to those found in
the Manufacturer section. The format of this section is:</p>

<p>device-description =
install-section-name, PNP-id[,PNP-id]…</p>

<p><i>device-description</i>
is a string (usually via a macro) that describes the device.</p>

<p><i>install-section-name</i>
is the name of a section created by the .INF file writer, which contains the
directives for installing the driver for the device.</p>

<p><i>PNP-id</i> is either a
hardware ID or compatible ID.</p>

<p>In the following example, the system device installer would
start at the beginning of the Manufacturer section when searching for an .INF
file for a particular device. It would then search the .INF file for the models
section [California_Death_Beams], which contains a
list of the devices from that manufacturer that are supported by this .INF
file. If none of the hardware IDs or compatible IDs in the [California_Death_Beams]
models section match what the installer is looking for, it will then look at
the next entry in the Manufacturer section. It would then search the .INF file
for the [Texas_Techo_Gizmo] models section, and
examine the hardware IDs and compatible IDs listed. If it finds a match, then
it has determined that this .INF file supports the device, and the specified
install-section-name will install the driver for the device.</p>

<h2>InstallComponent</h2>

<p>This section (also called DDInstallSection
in the DDK documentation), performs the actions required to install the driver
for the device. The name of this section is determined by the .INF file writer,
and is referenced in the Models section.</p>

<p>This section supports many different directives; the most
common are CopyFiles and AddReg.</p>

<p>The <i>CopyFiles</i>
directive specifies the name of one or more sections created by the .INF file
writer that contain a list of file names (previously specified in the SourceDisksFiles section) to be copied.</p>

<p>The AddReg directive specifies the
name of one or more sections created by the .INF file writer that contain a
list of entries to add to the registry.</p>

<h2>.Services</h2>

<p>After the InstallComponent section
has been run, the system device installer will search the .INF file for a
section name that is identical to the InstallComponent
section, with the suffix ".Services". The .Services section is used to add
entries to the "services" key in the registry, describing the driver to the
service control manager.</p>

<p>This section supports several different directives, but the
most common is AddService.</p>

<p>The <i>AddService</i>
directive specifies the name of a section created by the .INF file writer that
contains a series of directives that describes the driver.</p>

<h2>.HW</h2>

<p>This section is primarily used for installing PnP filter
drivers. After the .Services section has been run, the system device installer
will search the .INF file for a section name that is identical to the InstallComponent section, with the suffix ".HW". The .HW
section is used to add entries to the "hardware" key (HKLM\System\CCS\Enum\&lt;enumerator&gt;\&lt;device-id&gt;\&lt;instance-id&gt;).</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">;+<br>

[AddReg-HW] <br>
HKR,,&quot;UpperFilters&quot;,0x00010000,&quot;Snoopy&quot;</font></p>

<p>This section supports several different directives, but the
most common is AddReg, which specifies a section (created
by the .INF file writer) containing an entry to be added to the registry.
Specify the key "UpperFilters" to load your driver as
an upper filter (on top of the FDO), or "LowerFilters"
to load your driver as a lower filter (below the FDO).</p>

<p>"OK", I asked my budding .INF file writers, "any questions?"</p>

<p>They said that they all understood.</p>

<p>"OK, now you get to apply a little of the knowledge you just
gained. Following are a few questions that you should all be able to answer", I
said.</p>

<h1>Quiz</h1>

<p>After reading this tutorial, you should be able to answer
the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What section in an .INF file is used to install a hardware-specific function filter?

<li>What is the Manufacturer section used for?

<li>What types devices must have their PnP Ids listed in the [ControlFlags]
ExcludeFromSelect directive? Why?

<li>What is the Strings section used for?
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;What do you know! The furry little guys got all the answers
correct, and they all ambled off into the wood to continue on their various
projects. As the little pig walked away, he still regarded me with suspicion,
as he watched his back.</p>

<p>"Say hello to Oscar Mayer for me!",
I called back to him.</p>
